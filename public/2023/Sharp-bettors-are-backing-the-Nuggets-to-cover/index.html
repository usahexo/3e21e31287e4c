            <h1 id="Sharp-bettors-are-backing-the-Nuggets-to-cover"><a href="#Sharp-bettors-are-backing-the-Nuggets-to-cover" class="headerlink" title="Sharp bettors are backing the Nuggets to cover"></a>Sharp bettors are backing the Nuggets to cover</h1><p>The Denver Nuggets have been on a tear lately, winning seven of their last ten games. More importantly, they’ve been covering the spread in most of those contests. Sharp bettors are confident that this hot streak will continue against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The Jazz are coming off a home victory over the Lakers, but they’re still just 16-19 overall this season. They’ve had trouble winning on the road, going 3-10 in away games so far. The Nuggets, meanwhile, are a respectable 14-15 at home.</p>
<p>Denver has been playing well defensively lately, allowing just 99.8 points per game in their last ten contests. They should be able to keep the Jazz under control, especially with Nikola Jokic leading the way. The big man is averaging 20.1 points, 11.5 rebounds and 5.3 assists over his last ten games.</p>
<p>Jazz guard Ricky Rubio is listed as questionable for Wednesday’s game due to an ankle injury. If he doesn’t play, that will only help the Nuggets chances of covering the spread. Utah is already a touchdown underdog in this contest, so they would need Rubio to play if they want a chance at winning outright.</p>
<p>With all of these factors in mind, it’s easy to see why sharp bettors are backing Denver to cover on Wednesday night. The Nuggets have been playing well and should be able to take down the Jazz without too much trouble.</p>
<h1 id="Nuggets-are-a-sharp-play-against-the-Kings"><a href="#Nuggets-are-a-sharp-play-against-the-Kings" class="headerlink" title="Nuggets are a sharp play against the Kings"></a>Nuggets are a sharp play against the Kings</h1><p>The Nuggets have been one of the league’s most disappointing teams this year, but they may have found their groove in recent games. They come into Wednesday’s matchup against the Kings as 3.5-point favorites, and I like them to cover that spread.</p>
<p>The Kings are coming off a huge upset win over the Warriors on Monday night, and they may be a bit overvalued coming into this game. The Nuggets have some of the best talent in the NBA at all positions, and I think they’ll be able to take advantage of Sacramento’s poor defense.</p>
<p> Nikola Jokic is one of the most underrated players in the NBA, and he should be able to dominate against DeMarcus Cousins. Gary Harris and Emmanuel Mudiay are also young players who are starting to turn things around, and I think they’ll be able to light up the Kings’ defense as well.</p>
<p>The Nuggets have been playing much better as of late, and I think they’ll take care of business against the Kings on Wednesday night.</p>
<h1 id="Nuggets-are-a-safe-pick-against-the-Pistons"><a href="#Nuggets-are-a-safe-pick-against-the-Pistons" class="headerlink" title="Nuggets are a safe pick against the Pistons"></a>Nuggets are a safe pick against the Pistons</h1><p>The Denver Nuggets have been one of the surprise teams in the NBA this season, and they will look to keep their momentum going when they take on the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Denver is currently in sixth place in the Western Conference with a record of 38-27, while Detroit is in 10th place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 28-39.</p>
<p>The Nuggets have been a good team against the spread this season, going 36-27-2 overall. They have also been strong against the Pistons over the years, going 12-4 against them over the last three seasons.</p>
<p>Denver is led by point guard Jamal Murray, who is averaging 18.8 points and 4.7 assists per game this season. Nikola Jokic is also having a stellar year for the Nuggets, averaging 20.1 points, 10.8 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game.</p>
<p>Detroit is led by Blake Griffin, who is averaging 24.5 points and 7.5 rebounds per game this season. Andre Drummond is also having a strong year for the Pistons, averaging 17.6 points and 15.0 rebounds per game.</p>
<p>The Nuggets are currently a 5.5 point favorite against the Pistons in Wednesday’s matchup. Denver has been a good home team this season, going 23-10 at Pepsi Center so far this year. Meanwhile, Detroit has struggled on the road, going just 11-24 away from home this season.</p>
<p>I expect Denver to win and cover the spread in Wednesday’s matchup against Detroit</p>
<h1 id="Sharp-money-is-coming-in-on-the-Nuggets"><a href="#Sharp-money-is-coming-in-on-the-Nuggets" class="headerlink" title="Sharp money is coming in on the Nuggets"></a>Sharp money is coming in on the Nuggets</h1><p>The Denver Nuggets are a team on the rise in the NBA. Led by Nikola Jokic, they have one of the most promising young cores in the league. Supported by Jamal Murray, Gary Harris and Paul Millsap, the Nuggets are looking to make a deep playoff run this season.</p>
<p>Sharp money is coming in on the Nuggets to win the Western Conference. They are currently +1200 at most sportsbooks, but this could move as we get closer to the start of the season. The Thunder are currently -300 favourites to win the Western Conference, but I expect the Nuggets to be right there with them at the end of the season.</p>
<p>Jokic is one of the most versatile players in the NBA. He can do it all – score, pass and rebound. Murray is also a breakout star, who is only going to get better with more experience. Harris is a deadeye shooter and Millsap is a veteran who knows how to win.</p>
<p>With this young core and some added depth this offseason, I expect the Nuggets to make a big jump this season. They should be able to make it out of the first round of the playoffs and give one of the top teams in the West a tough series. At +1200, now is a great time to bet on them to win it all.</p>
<h1 id="Denver-is-a-sharp-underdog-against-the-Rockets"><a href="#Denver-is-a-sharp-underdog-against-the-Rockets" class="headerlink" title="Denver is a sharp underdog against the Rockets"></a>Denver is a sharp underdog against the Rockets</h1><p>It’s been a tough year for the Denver Nuggets. They started off the season strong, but injuries have taken their toll on the team. Nikola Jokic, Gary Harris, and Paul Millsap have all missed extended time due to various ailments, and as a result, the Nuggets have fallen out of playoff contention.</p>
<p>Denver is currently in 11th place in the Western Conference, eight games behind the 8th-place Los Angeles Lakers. They face an uphill battle if they want to make the playoffs—especially considering that they have to go through the Rockets.</p>
<p>Houston is one of the best teams in the NBA this season. They’re currently in 2nd place in the West with a record of 48-22, and they have one of the most explosive offenses in the league. James Harden is having an MVP-caliber season, and he’s surrounded by plenty of other dangerous players like Chris Paul and Clint Capela.</p>
<p>The Nuggets are going to be heavy underdogs in this series. But that doesn’t mean they can’t pull off an upset. They’ve already shown that they can compete with the best teams in the NBA; they’ve beaten Houston twice this season.</p>
<p>If Denver can stay healthy and play to their potential, they definitely have a chance of knocking off the Rockets. It won’t be easy—but it certainly isn’t impossible.</p>
