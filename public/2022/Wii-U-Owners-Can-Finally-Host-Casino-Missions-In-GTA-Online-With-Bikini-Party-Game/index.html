<h1 id="Play-As-A-Sexy-Lady-In-GTA-Online’s-New-Bikini-Party-Game"><a href="#Play-As-A-Sexy-Lady-In-GTA-Online’s-New-Bikini-Party-Game" class="headerlink" title="Play As A Sexy Lady In GTA Online’s New Bikini Party Game"></a>Play As A Sexy Lady In GTA Online’s New Bikini Party Game</h1><p>Rockstar Games has just announced a new game mode for Grand Theft Auto Online called Bikini Party. The new game mode is all about playing as a sexy lady and enjoying the sun and fun in the company of other bikini-clad players.</p>
<p>The new game mode is currently available in GTA Online’s southernmost state, Los Santos, and it promises to be a blast! Whether you’re looking to soak up some rays on the beach or take a swim in the ocean, Bikini Party is the perfect place to do it.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s plenty of fun to be had on dry land too. Race your friends down the pier, play games of beach volleyball, or just hang out and soak up the sun. Whatever you do, make sure to wear your best bikini – you’re going to need it!</p>
<h1 id="Rockstar-Adds-Bikini-CladFemale-Characters-To-GTA-Online"><a href="#Rockstar-Adds-Bikini-CladFemale-Characters-To-GTA-Online" class="headerlink" title="Rockstar Adds Bikini-CladFemale Characters To GTA Online"></a>Rockstar Adds Bikini-CladFemale Characters To GTA Online</h1><p>In a move that is sure to anger some and excite others, Rockstar has announced that it is adding bikini-clad female characters to GTA Online. In a statement, the company said that the new characters will be “sexy and fun” and that they are “perfect for summertime in Los Santos.”</p>
<p>While some accuse Rockstar of pandering to a male audience with its decision, many gamers are excited about the prospect of playing as a scantily clad woman in one of the world’s most popular video games. One fan even started a petition demanding that the new characters be added to GTA Online.</p>
<p>So far, Rockstar hasn’t released any images of the new characters, but gamers can expect them to be strikingly beautiful and curvaceous. It’s likely that they will also be wearing very little clothing, something that is sure to stir up controversy among those who believe that games should be family-friendly.</p>
<p>Whether you love or hate the decision, there’s no doubt that bikini-clad women in GTA Online are going to generate a lot of buzz. Rockstar is no stranger to controversy, and it seems happy to court it once again with this latest move.</p>
<h1 id="GTA-Online-New-Game-Mode-Lets-You-Play-As-A-Sexy-Female-Character"><a href="#GTA-Online-New-Game-Mode-Lets-You-Play-As-A-Sexy-Female-Character" class="headerlink" title="GTA Online: New Game Mode Lets You Play As A Sexy Female Character"></a>GTA Online: New Game Mode Lets You Play As A Sexy Female Character</h1><p>Rockstar Games has announced a new game mode for Grand Theft Auto Online that will let players play as a sexy female character. The new game mode, called “Girlfriend Mode,” will allow players to interact with other players as romantic partners.</p>
<p>In Girlfriend Mode, players can flirt, romance, and even propose marriage to other players. They can also dress up their characters in sexy outfits, and go on dates and outings together.</p>
<p>“Girlfriend Mode is the perfect way for players to experience the fun of Grand Theft Auto Online with their friends,” said Rockstar Games spokesperson Dan Houser. “It’s a great way to socialize and have some fun with your friends.”</p>
<p>Girlfriend Mode is currently available as a free update for Grand Theft Auto Online on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC platforms.</p>

<p>This one is different, though. Rockstar has finally introduced us to Brittany, a curvaceous redhead that looks like she could give any bikini model a run for her money.</p>
<p>Some people are criticizing Rockstar for objectifying women with this new character, but there’s no need to worry. She’s not just there for show; Brittany actually has some pretty interesting things to offer gamers.</p>
<p>For one, she’s got a wicked sense of humor and loves to mess with people. She’s also an excellent driver and can easily take down any opponent in a race or fight. Not to mention, she’s drop-dead gorgeous!</p>
<p>So far, Brittany seems like a well-rounded character that will definitely add some much-needed excitement to GTA Online. Make sure you add her to your crew today!</p>
