            <h1 id="Who-Owns-Hollywood-Casino-in-Harrisburg"><a href="#Who-Owns-Hollywood-Casino-in-Harrisburg" class="headerlink" title="Who Owns Hollywood Casino in Harrisburg?"></a>Who Owns Hollywood Casino in Harrisburg?</h1><p>The casino is located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Hollywood Casino is owned by Penn National Gaming.

<h1 id="Monaco-Purchases-Hollywood-Casino-in-Harrisburg"><a href="#Monaco-Purchases-Hollywood-Casino-in-Harrisburg" class="headerlink" title="Monaco Purchases Hollywood Casino in Harrisburg"></a>Monaco Purchases Hollywood Casino in Harrisburg</h1><p>The Principality of Monaco announced today that it has agreed to purchase the Hollywood Casino in Harrisburg, PA.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of high-profile investments by Monaco, including its recent acquisition of the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about this new venture,” said Prince Albert II of Monaco. “The Hollywood Casino is a world-class facility, and we look forward to bringing our expertise to bear in order to make it even more successful.”</p>
<p>The Hollywood Casino is one of the largest gaming establishments in Pennsylvania, with over 1,000 slot machines and 30 table games. It is also one of the most profitable casinos in the state, generating over $70 million in revenue last year.</p>
<p>Prince Albert II of Monaco praised the casino’s employees and promised that they would all keep their jobs under the new ownership. “We are committed to ensuring that the Hollywood Casino remains a top-notch entertainment destination for residents of Harrisburg and beyond,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-the-new-owner-of-Hollywood-Casino-Harrisburg"><a href="#Who-is-the-new-owner-of-Hollywood-Casino-Harrisburg" class="headerlink" title="Who is the new owner of Hollywood Casino Harrisburg?"></a>Who is the new owner of Hollywood Casino Harrisburg?</h1><p>The Hollywood Casino in Harrisburg, PA has been sold for an undisclosed amount. The new owner is an investment company out of Chicago, IL named IGT (International Game Technology) Holdings Corporation.</p>
<p>This news comes as a bit of a surprise to the casino industry as it was recently reported that Penn National Gaming, the current owner of the Hollywood Casino, was in talks to sell the casino to MGM Resorts International for $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>The sale of the Hollywood Casino by Penn National Gaming is said to be part of a larger move by the company to focus on growing its regional gaming business.</p>
<p>IGT Holdings Corporation stated in a press release that it plans on investing “significant capital” into the Hollywood Casino to bring “world-class gaming and entertainment options” to the property.</p>
<h1 id="What-will-happen-to-the-future-of-Hollywood-Casino-Harrisburg"><a href="#What-will-happen-to-the-future-of-Hollywood-Casino-Harrisburg" class="headerlink" title="What will happen to the future of Hollywood Casino Harrisburg?"></a>What will happen to the future of Hollywood Casino Harrisburg?</h1><p>The Hollywood Casino Harrisburg is a casino and hotel in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It is owned by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. The casino has 1,952 slot machines and 60 table games.</p>
<p>The future of Hollywood Casino Harrisburg is uncertain. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has been investigating allegations of illegal conduct at the casino since March 2018. In May 2018, the PGCB revoked the casino’s license and ordered it to close.</p>
<p>In June 2018, the Sands Corporation filed a lawsuit against the PGCB. The lawsuit alleges that the PGCB violated the company’s rights by revoking the license without due process. The lawsuit also alleges that the PGCB was motivated by political reasons.</p>
<p>The future of Hollywood Casino Harrisburg will likely be resolved in court.</p>
<h1 id="Monaco-invests-in-Hollywood-Casino-Harrisburg"><a href="#Monaco-invests-in-Hollywood-Casino-Harrisburg" class="headerlink" title="Monaco invests in Hollywood Casino Harrisburg"></a>Monaco invests in Hollywood Casino Harrisburg</h1><p>In the latest news, Monaco has announced that it is investing in Hollywood Casino Harrisburg. The move is seen as a way to help revive the casino, which has been struggling in recent years.</p>
<p>The casino, which is located in the state capital of Pennsylvania, first opened its doors in 2007. However, it has seen a decline in business in recent years due to increased competition from other casinos in the region.</p>
<p>Monaco’s investment is expected to help turn things around for Hollywood Casino Harrisburg. The company plans to invest $50 million into the casino, with the goal of making it a premier gaming destination.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear what specific changes will be made at the casino, but Monaco says that it plans to make significant improvements. These improvements will include new gaming options, a redesign of the casino floor, and an upgrade of the hotel facilities.</p>
<p>“This investment will breathe new life into Hollywood Casino Harrisburg,” said Monaco CEO Jim Murren. “We are committed to making this property one of the top destinations for gaming and entertainment in the Northeast.”</p>
<p>Monaco’s investment comes at a time when casinos across the United States are facing increasing competition from online gambling operators. In Pennsylvania, for example, online casinos have been thriving in recent years due to their low taxes and lack of regulation.</p>
<p>This has caused some brick-and-mortar casinos in Pennsylvania to struggle, including Hollywood Casino Harrisburg. Monaco’s investment should help revive the casino and keep it competitive against online gambling operators.</p>
