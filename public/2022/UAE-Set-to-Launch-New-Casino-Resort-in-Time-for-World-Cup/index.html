The $670 million project, called “Crowne Plaza Resort &amp; Casino”, is being developed by the Al Jaber Group and will cover an area of 240,000 square feet. It will be located in the heart of Abu Dhabi and will offer a range of gambling options, including a casino, sports betting lounge, and slots.</p>
<p>The resort is also expected to include a luxury hotel with over 400 rooms, as well as a number of restaurants and cafes. It’s hoped that the new development will help to attract more tourists to Abu Dhabi, especially during the world cup. The UAE has already been making preparations for the tournament, with new stadiums being built and additional security measures put in place.</p>
<p>The casino resort is scheduled to open in March 2018, just ahead of the world cup which kicks off in June. It will be one of several new gambling venues to open in the UAE over the next few years, as the country looks to tap into the lucrative Asian market. The Crowne Plaza Resort &amp; Casino is expected to create over 1,200 jobs, and will be managed by Hilton Worldwide.</p>
<h1 id="UAE-Casino-Resort-Welcomes-Players-with-Twice-the-Gamble"><a href="#UAE-Casino-Resort-Welcomes-Players-with-Twice-the-Gamble" class="headerlink" title="UAE Casino Resort Welcomes Players with Twice the Gamble"></a>UAE Casino Resort Welcomes Players with Twice the Gamble</h1><p>The glitz and glamour of a casino resort is now twice as tempting for players in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The recently opened Al Sahra Casino Resort in Dubai offers an unparalleled gaming experience, with twice the number of gaming tables and slots compared to traditional casinos.</p>
<p>This luxurious resort welcomes guests with over 200 gaming tables, 2,000 slot machines, and a wide range of other popular casino games. Whether you’re looking to try your luck on the blackjack table or take a break from the action in one of the many bars and restaurants, there’s something for everyone at Al Sahra Casino Resort.</p>
<p>With such a large choice of games on offer, it can be difficult to know where to start. If you’re new to gambling, our handy guide will give you all the information you need to get started.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Gamble-In-A-Casino"><a href="#How-To-Gamble-In-A-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How To Gamble In A Casino"></a>How To Gamble In A Casino</h1><p>If you want to gamble in a casino, there are a few things you need to know first. Here are our top tips for beginners:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn The Rules</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you start playing any games in a casino, it’s important to learn the rules. This will help you understand how the game works and give you a better chance of winning. Casinos usually have leaflets or brochures explaining the rules of each game, so make sure you take one with you when you head to the casino.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Gamble Responsibly</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambling should always be enjoyed responsibly. Don’t spend more money than you can afford to lose, and remember that gambling is not a guaranteed way to make money. If you’re worried about your gambling habits, there are organisations like GamCare who can offer advice and support.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Dress Smartly</li>
</ol>
<p>Casinos are usually quite formal places, so it’s important to dress smartly when visiting one. There’s no need to go out and buy a new outfit especially for your trip to the casino resort, but avoid wearing anything too casual or revealing. Women should avoid wearing miniskirts or plunging necklines, and men should avoid wearing shorts or open-toe shoes.</p>

<h1 id="UAE-Ready-to-Ramp-Up-Gambling-Industry-with-New-Resort"><a href="#UAE-Ready-to-Ramp-Up-Gambling-Industry-with-New-Resort" class="headerlink" title="UAE Ready to Ramp Up Gambling Industry with New Resort"></a>UAE Ready to Ramp Up Gambling Industry with New Resort</h1><p>The UAE is all set to rev up its gambling industry with the launch of a new luxury resort in the country. The mammoth project, which is being developed by Las Vegas Sands, will feature an integrated casino and hotel. Reportedly, the company has already secured all the necessary permissions from the relevant authorities and is now in the process of finalizing the arrangements.</p>
<p>The new resort, which is expected to be completed by 2020, will be located on Abu Dhabi’s Yas Island. It will feature a total of 700 hotel rooms and suites, as well as a range of world-class gaming facilities. The casino will offer both traditional and contemporary games, including poker, blackjack and roulette. There will also be a number of restaurants and bars on site, as well as a state-of-the-art spa and fitness center.</p>
<p>The development is likely to be a major boon for the UAE’s tourism industry, which has seen steady growth in recent years. In fact, according to figures from the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC), the sector is expected to grow by 4% annually until 2027. Commenting on the news, Niall Fitzgerald, CEO of Las Vegas Sands Europe said: “We are excited to bring our world-class integrated resort offering to Abu Dhabi and further fuel the fantastic growth that we are seeing in this important market”.</p>
<p>The UAE has long been one of the biggest gambling hubs in the Middle East, thanks to its relaxed licensing laws and sophisticated infrastructure. In recent years however, neighboring countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia have begun relaxing their own gambling regulations, posing a serious threat to the UAE’s market share. It is hoped that the new resort will help keep Abu Dhabi at the forefront of the regional gambling scene.</p>
<h1 id="Dubai-Casino-Resort-set-to-Double-Down-on-Entertainment"><a href="#Dubai-Casino-Resort-set-to-Double-Down-on-Entertainment" class="headerlink" title="Dubai Casino Resort set to Double Down on Entertainment"></a>Dubai Casino Resort set to Double Down on Entertainment</h1><p>The Dubai Casino Resort is looking to double down on its entertainment offerings. The property, which is set to open in 2020, is looking to add a major attraction that will rival the likes of Disneyland and Universal Studios.</p>
<p>“We are working on a top secret attraction that will rival the best in the world and will be announced in the coming months,” said a spokesperson for the Dubai Casino Resort.</p>
<p>The new attraction will be in addition to the already announced Ferrari World theme park, which is slated to open later this year.</p>
<p>The resort is also planning to expand its casino floor by 40%.</p>
<p>Dubai Casino Resort has been designed to cater to high rollers from around the world. The resort will feature two luxury hotels with a total of 1,600 rooms, as well as a convention center and retail district.</p>
