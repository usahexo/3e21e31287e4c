#  Warm Springs or Welches: Which is Closer to 50 Deuces Wild Hands?

Welches and Warm Springs are the two locales vying for the title of "closest to 50 Deuces Wild hands." The game, which is a variation of poker, is played with a deck of 52 cards. In each hand, the player is dealt two deuces and tries to make as many five-card hands as possible.

The winner is the person who can make the most five-card hands using their two deuces. This could be as few as one hand or as many as 10 hands, depending on the cards that are dealt.

To determine which locale is closer to 50 Deuces Wild hands, we first need to establish some parameters. We'll use a pack of 52 cards, so each hand will have four cards. This means that there are 204 possible winning hands.

Now we need to determine how often each of these hands can be made in each locale. For this calculation, we'll assume that each card is equally likely to be drawn. This isn't always true in practice, but it's a fair approximation for our purposes.

There are 13 unique card combinations in a four-card hand (2x2, 3x1, 4x0, etc). This means that each locale will have one of these 13 combinations occur once every 204 times that the game is played.

Since Warm Springs is closer to 50 Deuces Wild hands, it will have one of these 13 combinations occur more often than Welches does. In fact, Warm Springs will have one of these 13 combinations occur exactly 50 times out of 204 games played (or 24% of the time). This means that if you play 100 games at both Warm Springs and Welches, you would expect to see 26 winning hands at Warm Springs and only 24 at Welches.
