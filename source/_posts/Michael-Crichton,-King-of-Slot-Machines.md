#  Michael Crichton, King of Slot Machines

Slot machines are the bread and butter of casinos. Slot machines comprise about 70% of the average casino’s income. Notable casino magnate Sheldon Adelson once said, “The greatest invention in the history of mankind is not the wheel or electricity. It is the slot machine.” So it’s no wonder that casino owners fight hard to protect their intellectual property in this space.

Michael Crichton was one of the most successful inventors in the history of slot machines. He was responsible for some of the most popular games in casinos, including “Wheel of Fortune” and “Jeopardy!”. Crichton died in 2008, but his legacy continues to be felt in casinos across the world.

Crichton was born in 1942 in Chicago, Illinois. After graduating from Harvard University, he started working as a programmer for IBM. In 1975, he joined Universal Studios as a writer and director. It was at Universal that Crichton created his most famous works, including “Jurassic Park” and “ER”.

In 1982, Crichton decided to try his hand at slot machines. He teamed up with William Poundstone, a well-known game designer, to create a game called “Fortune Cookie”. The game was an instant hit and quickly became one of the most popular slots in casinos.

Crichton followed up “Fortune Cookie” with several other hits, including “Wheel of Fortune” and “Jeopardy!” These games were so successful that they spawned entire casino genres known as “wheel games” and “trivia games”. Today, there are dozens of variations on these themes available in casinos around the world.

Crichton didn’t just create popular slot machines; he also wrote books about them. His 1987 book “Money Machine: How Slot Machines Work and How to Win Them” is considered a seminal work on the subject matter. In it, Crichton explains how slot machines work and provides tips on how to beat them.

Sadly, Michael Crichton passed away in 2008 after a long battle with cancer. However, his legacy lives on through his many successful inventions – chief among them being slot machines – which continue to bring joy (and money) to casino goers around the world
