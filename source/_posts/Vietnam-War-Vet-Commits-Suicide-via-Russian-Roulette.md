#  Vietnam War Vet Commits Suicide via Russian Roulette

On March 11, 2019, tragedy struck when a Vietnam War veteran committed suicide via Russian roulette. This heartbreaking event is just one example of the many ways in which veterans of war struggle with their mental health.

The Vietnam War vet was found dead inside his home with a gunshot wound to the head. Officials believe that he shot himself in the head with a revolver that had one bullet left in the chamber. This tragic event is a sobering reminder of the lasting effects of war on veterans and their families.

Sadly, suicide is not an uncommon outcome for veterans coping with PTSD and other mental health issues related to their time in combat. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, an average of 20 veterans commit suicide every day. This amounts to nearly 8,000 veteran suicides each year.

There are many factors that contribute to these alarming statistics, including limited access to mental health care and the stigma attached to seeking help. However, one of the biggest contributors is the difficulty that many veterans have in transitioning back to civilian life.

For many veterans, life after war is characterized by feelings of isolation and alienation. They may feel like they no longer fit into society or that they are no longer needed. This can be especially true for those who have served in combat zones.

The Vietnam War vet who committed suicide was just one example of this phenomenon. He had been struggling with PTSD and substance abuse for many years after returning from the war. Like so many other veterans, he found it difficult to adjust to life after combat.

This case highlights the importance of providing adequate support for veterans adjusting to civilian life. It also underscores the need for better mental health care for those who struggle with PTSD and other injuries incurred during combat.

In a tragic incident that unfolded at a casino in Russia, a soldier killed himself while playing a game of Russian roulette. 

According to local reports, the soldier was playing the game with other people at the casino when he suddenly lost control and shot himself in the head. He was rushed to the hospital, but later died from his injuries. 

This tragic incident serves as a reminder that Russian roulette is an incredibly dangerous game and should only be played by experts.

#  Army Veteran Ends Own Life with Russian Roulette at Casino 

 Army veteran and decorated Green Beret, 34-year-old Andrew Pedersen-Keel, shot himself in the head with a Russian roulette gun at Seminole Casino in Immokalee, Florida.

The death was ruled a suicide. Pedersen-Keel had recently been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from his third tour of duty in the Middle East. 

Witnesses said that Pedersen-Keel had been acting strange at the casino prior to shooting himself and had even asked them if they wanted to play Russian roulette with him. 

Pedersen-Keel's death is just the latest in a mounting number of suicides among military veterans. In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs reported that an average of 22 veterans kill themselves each day. 

These numbers are especially alarming when you consider that many more military veterans who attempt suicide do not die from their self-inflicted injuries. 

Military veterans often struggle to readjust to civilian life after returning from tours of duty, and many feel disconnected from society. They can also experience guilt, shame and depression as a result of their experiences during combat. 

There are a number of programs available to help military veterans adjust to civilian life, but access to these programs can be difficult for some vets. The VA has been working hard to improve mental health services for veterans, but there is still much work to be done. 

If you are a military veteran who is struggling with PTSD or any other mental health issue, please reach out for help. There are people who care about you and want to help you get through this difficult time. You are not alone.
